            <p>
              Designing User Interfaces and User Experiences is our historical
              area of expertise, and remains the lifeblood of our business to
              this today. When it comes to web design, the two concepts are
              inseparable. User Experience (UX) covers usability, functionality,
              and navigation. Our rigorous focus in this area involves
              prototyping and testing of all possible solutions to a given
              problem. Then comes artistic creation (UI), which is directed by
              Barthelemy. This process seeks not only to bring a visual identity
              to the product, but also to serve the apps underlying purpose
              while ensuring the best possible experience for the user.
